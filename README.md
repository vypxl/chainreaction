# Chain Reaction

This repo contains a reimplementation and reinterpretation of the mobile game
[Chain Reaction](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BuddyMattEnt.ChainReaction)
by Buddy Matt Entertainment.

It runs in the browser using HTML Canvas and Webassembly.

This version of the game is not meant to be played in multiplayer, but rather to experiment with
patterns and complex behaviour that emerges from the game's rules.

## How to use

To start serving the web application, install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
and run `npm install -g pnpm` and then `pnpm install` and `pnpm start`.
